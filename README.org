* Chaos Game
  Chaos game implementation as presented in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs
* Rules
  1. Pick N points in a 2D plane
  2. Pick a starting position
  3. Randomly select one of the points from 1.
  4. Move to a new position that is half way between last position and the selected point
     (it doesn't have to be half way, it can be a third or anything else)
  5. Repeat step 3 and on as many times as wanted.
* Expected output
  If we draw each new point, we should get certain fractal representations, which
change depending on the number and position of the starting points and the fraction
distance we travel
* Implementation
** ChaosGame
  Types and useful general implementations
** ChaosCalc
  Takes info about the game and calculates the points
** DrawPoints
  Has implementations for actually showing the points
*** Currently has 2 implementations:
    - One based on Doodle, which is short and stackoverflows fairly easily
    - One based on java.swing.Graphics which is a bit uglier but can draw as much as we want
** ChaosMain
  This wires things together and runs the game
** ChaosInitialState
  Allows for loading of initial state to be used for ChaosCalc
*** Implementations:
    - RandomInitialState
      - Has preset width, height, # of points and iterations
      - Randomly chooses start and game positions
    - CompiledInitialState
      - Has everything preset in the code
      - Works when running directly from sbt, without having to parse a config file
