* Chaos Game
  Chaos game implementation as presented in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs
* Rules
  1. Pick N points in a 2D plane and label them
  2. Pick a random starting position
  3. Randomly select one of the points from 1.
  4. New position is half way between last position and the selected point
  5. Repeat from 3 on as many times as wanted.
* Expected output
  If we draw each new point, we should get certain fractal representations, which
change depending on the number of starting points.
